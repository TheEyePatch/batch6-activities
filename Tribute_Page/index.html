            <h5 id="Elon">Who is He?</h5>
              <p>Elon Musk is the co-founder of PayPal, Tesla Motors and SolarCity, and the founder of SpaceX and The Boring Company.
                  His astounding success has given rise to comparison of Musk to Steve Jobs, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes and Bill Gates.
                  Due to his difficult childhood, Elon Musk developed a relentless work ethic and tenacious single-minded vision, which I believe
                  led him to his success.
              </p>
            <h5 id="F_Background">Family Background</h5>
            <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, one of South Africa's three capital cities. His father was an engineer and his mother was a model and nutritionist.
              He is the oldest of three children in an ambitious family. His brother Kimbal Musk is currently a venture capitalist and environmentalist.His sister Tosca Musk is an award-winning producer and director.
            <h5 id="SpaceX">SpaceX</h5>
            <p>In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis", a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse containing seeds with dehydrated gel on Mars to grow plants on Martian soil, "so this would be the furthest that life's ever traveled"
               in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and increase the budget of NASA. But Musk realized that even with a much larger space budget, travel to Mars would be prohibitively expensive without a fundamental breakthrough in rocket technology.
               In October 2001, Musk traveled with a group to Moscow to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras;
                however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras
                and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets. With $100 million of his early fortune,[70] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.

            <h5 id ="Boring">The Boring Company</h5>
            <p>On December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted "[I] am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging ..." He then founded 'The Boring Company' (TBC).
              On January 21, 2017, Musk tweeted "Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so."
              The Boring Company's projects are designed for loop intra-city transit systems although the company has stated that the Hawthorne test tunnel can support Hyperloop R&D and that current tunnels are being built so they could support eventual transition to Hyperloop-based transportation on longer inter-city routes.
              Musk cited difficulty with Los Angeles traffic and what he sees as limitations with the current two-dimensional transportation network as his early inspiration for the project.
              The Boring Company was initially formed as a subsidiary of SpaceX, becoming a separate and fully independent company in 2018.

            <h5 id="NeuraLink">NeuraLink</h5>
            <p>Neuralink Corporation is an USA neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk and others, developing implantable brainâ€“machine interfaces (BMIs).
              In April 2017, the blog Wait But Why reported that the company was aiming to make devices to treat serious brain diseases in the short-term, with the eventual goal of human enhancement, sometimes called transhumanism.
              Musk said his interest in the idea partly stemmed from the science fiction concept of "neural lace" in the fictional universe in The Culture, a series of 10 novels by Iain M. Banks.<br>
              Musk defined the neural lace as a "digital layer above the cortex" that would not necessarily imply extensive surgical insertion but ideally an implant through a vein or artery.
              As of 2017, some neuroprosthetics can interpret brain signals and allow disabled people to control their prosthetic arms and legs. Musk spoke of aiming to link that technology with implants that, instead of actuating movement, can interface at broadband speed
              with other types of external software and gadgets.
